C programmer trained at 42, with a focus on building reliable, low-level software. Interested in how systems work beneath the surface, actively expanding my portfolio with practical projects and seeking my first role in software development. Seeking a junior role in C development or low-level programming where I can build on my training, keep learning through hands-on work, and contribute to real software projects in a supportive environment.

## Projects

**Minishell** – C, Unix  
- Reverse engineered Bash behavior to build a functional clone.  
- Implemented parsing, pipelines, redirection, signal handling, and builtins.  
- No use of stdio or libc; custom string/memory functions used throughout.

**Libft** – C  
- Recreated the C standard library functions from scratch, with strict norm compliance.
- Used as a foundation for later system-level projects.
- Practiced implementation of low-level data structures and algorithms.

**BSQ (big square)** - C
- Efficient algorithm to find the biggest square on a grid avoiding obstacles.
- Bit level memory management.
